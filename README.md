# Cars-Sales-Dashboard
* Problem: The car dealership company lacks an efficient system to track and analyze its sales performance. Without a comprehensive Car Sales Dashboard, they are unable to visualize and understand critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to their car sales. This hinders their ability to make data-driven decisions and effectively monitor their sales performance over time.

* Solution: The proposed solution is to design and develop a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. Power BI is a powerful business intelligence tool that allows for data visualization and analysis. The dashboard will provide a centralized platform to track and monitor key metrics such as total sales, revenue, average selling price, sales by car model, and sales by region.
