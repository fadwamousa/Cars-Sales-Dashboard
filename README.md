# Cars-Sales-Dashboard
* Problem: The car dealership company lacks an efficient system to track and analyze its sales performance. Without a comprehensive Car Sales Dashboard, they are unable to visualize and understand critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to their car sales. This hinders their ability to make data-driven decisions and effectively monitor their sales performance over time.

* Solution: The proposed solution is to design and develop a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. Power BI is a powerful business intelligence tool that allows for data visualization and analysis. The dashboard will provide a centralized platform to track and monitor key metrics such as total sales, revenue, average selling price, sales by car model, and sales by region.

The car dealership company requires a comprehensive Car Sales Dashboard in Power BI to track and analyze sales performance effectively. The objective is to develop an interactive and dynamic dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to our sales data. This will enable us to make informed decisions, monitor progress, and identify trends and growth opportunities.

The dashboard will include essential metrics such as Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) total sales, Year-over-Year (YOY) growth in total sales, average prices, and cars sold. Additionally, it will compare YTD metrics with Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) metrics to measure performance.

the dashboard include a line chart showcasing the weekly trend of YTD sales, a pie chart displaying the distribution of YTD total sales by body style and color, and a map chart illustrating YTD sales by dealer region. Furthermore, a tabular grid will present the sales trend for each company, and a detailed grid will provide comprehensive information about each car sale, including model, body style, color, sales amount, dealer region, and date.

The Dataset contain the following fields:
* Car_id:
* Date
* Customer Name
* Gender
* Annual Income
* Dealer_Name
* Company
* Model
* Engine
* Transmission
* Color
* Price ($)
* Dealer_No
* Body Style
* Phone
* Dealer_Region:
